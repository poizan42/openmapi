The server can be run using something like:

OPENMAPI_TARGET_HOST=127.0.0.1:7000 OPENMAPI_CERT_FILE=ca.cer OPENMAPI_KEY_FILE=ca.key mono --debug bin/nmapisvr.exe

SSL-certificate is *required*.

Currently, the cert/key can be provided in 2 forms:

1. A single PKCS12 encoded file, containing both certificate and private key.
2. Two separate files: One PEM encoded certificate and one PVK or PEM encoded private key.

For more information on the PVK key format, see http://www.drh-consultancy.demon.co.uk/pvk.html
